# Buddys-Pizza-Parlor-Demo

This demonstration was a finals project I worked on which tied together the concepts of Front-End Development utilizing 
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The attempt was to create a pizza ordering system for a pizza parlor for customers.

Where it lacks perfection in overall style it makes up for in functionality.  Enjoy.
